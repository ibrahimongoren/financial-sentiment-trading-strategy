# 📊 Financial Sentiment Analysis for Trading Strategy Evaluation

This repository presents an end-to-end framework that transforms financial news
sentiment into systematic trading signals and evaluates their performance using
a realistic, risk-aware backtesting methodology.

The project bridges **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Quantitative Finance**
by demonstrating how unstructured textual data can be incorporated into
interpretable trading strategies.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is **methodological demonstration**, not return
maximization. The focus is on building a transparent, reproducible pipeline that
covers the full lifecycle from sentiment extraction to strategy evaluation.

The workflow includes:
- Sentiment analysis of financial news headlines
- Rule-based trading signal generation (long / short / neutral)
- Transaction cost–aware backtesting
- Risk-adjusted performance evaluation

---

## 🧠 Methodological Focus

This project emphasizes:
- Robust signal engineering rather than curve fitting
- Risk metrics (drawdown, volatility) alongside returns
- Realistic assumptions such as transaction costs

Results are **illustrative**, designed to validate the framework rather than to
claim trading profitability.

## 📊 Performance Evaluation

Strategy performance is assessed using:
- Cumulative and annualized returns
- Volatility and Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate analysis

A custom backtesting class is implemented to ensure clarity and extensibility.
